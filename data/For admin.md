# For Admin

As an admin, you can easily add a new product to Stripe and link it with a course on the website. Here are the step-by-step instructions to help you with the process, even if you are not technically savvy:

1. **Add a new product to Stripe**: Before anything else, you should add a new product to Stripe. This can be done by logging in to your Stripe account and following the instructions provided by Stripe.
2. **Add Product ID to Admin**: Once you have created a new product on Stripe, you will need to add the Product ID to the admin section of the website. This will link the product to a course and allow users to purchase it. There are two fields available for the product, normal and early bird.
3. **Enroll in the Course**: When a user clicks the enroll button on the website, the backend will create a session object. Once the payment is successful, the status for this object will change to successful, and the webpage will be redirected to the success page.

By following these simple steps, you can make sure that your website is organized and easy to use for non-technical users.
